<p>As we stated in one of our previous blog posts, we will be releasing both minor and major events. At the moment, our team is working very hard on our next major event, which is set to release later this month. We understand that waiting can be difficult, so we decided to provide you with 3 new Workshop maps that you can try out: <a href="/workshop/1266210012">Vigil</a>, <a href="/workshop/648227046">Fifthcurve</a> and <a href="/workshop/1272700588">Kalinka</a>. Don't forget to vote for these maps on Steam Workshop if you want them to be introduced officially!</p>

<p>We have also updated the Creators campaign on the community Contracker to include contracts for these new maps. Don't forget to reinstall asset pack for faster load times! Thanks, and have fun.</p>
