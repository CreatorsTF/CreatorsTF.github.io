<p>Over the past few years, Team Fortress 2 has been receiving far less attention from developers, yet the game is still very much relevant. While we could continue to wait in endless anticipation, we can also take the game into our own hands! The goal of this project is to try and make unofficial updates to our beloved game with the help of community created content and, very importantly, with the authentic Team Fortress 2 spirit in mind.</p>
<p>This project is a great undertaking. That is why we address you, the TF2 community! We need the help of everyone who can and wants to do something to extend the life of our beloved game! We are introducing our <a href="{{site.url}}/promo">brand new, (hopefully) game-saving community project</a> designed to make custom community-driven updates!</p>
