<p>Happy Scream Fortress, everyone! We're still working with Merasmus to make our own Scream Fortress and to make sure it'll be a great event. Expect it to come later this month. Meanwhile, to celebrate this early release of Scream Fortress (so early we were all surprised), we're adding every official Halloween map in our rotation for you to enjoy!</p>
<p>See you soon!<p/>
